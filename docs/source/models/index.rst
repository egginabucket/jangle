Models
------

Django models are the basis of Jangle,
and are used to represent various standards,
tags, and subtags.

More information on submodules, including querysets and managers:

* :doc:`languages`
* :doc:`scripts`
* :doc:`regions`
* :doc:`tags`

.. note::

   Sphinx autodoc uses Django's docstrings
   for fields and other attributes generated by Django.
   I'm working to exclude and override these with empty docstrings,
   but there are still some weird docstrings floating around.
   You'll know when you see them.


.. automodule:: jangle.models
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :exclude-members: id, DoesNotExist, MultipleObjectsReturned,
      get_next_by_script_date, get_previous_by_script_date,
      get_next_by_file_date, get_previous_by_file_date,
      get_next_by_saved, get_previous_by_saved,
      get_next_by_added, get_previous_by_added,
      extlangsubtag_set, languagesubtag_set,
      languagetag_set,
