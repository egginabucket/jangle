Regular Expressions
-------------------

Jangle uses a variety of regular expressions for validating and parsing
language tags.

.. note::

   Most patterns are case-sensitive,
   which is incompliant with
   `RFC 5646 section 2.1 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html#section-2.1>`_.
   Use the `I` flag unless you are making sketchy inferences.
